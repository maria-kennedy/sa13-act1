            <h2>Meet Luna</h2>
            <!-- note: full transparency, i gave chatgpt a few notes and had it write this paragraph for me bc i despise creative writing.  -->
            <!-- its all true tho, Luna is my pup and she's the best  -->

                Meet Luna, the black pug with a palate for meaty delights 
                and a penchant for cheesy indulgences. When she's not lounging like a 
                pro on the comfiest spot in the house, Luna is busy charming her way 
                into playtime with her favorite human, Dad. But her true bliss? 
                That's reserved for snuggling sessions with Mom, where she transforms 
                into a velvety cuddle bug, soaking up warmth and affection like it's 
                her birthright. With Luna around, every day is a feast of meat, cheese, l
                azy moments, playful antics, and of course, endless cuddles. She's not 
                just a pug; she's a culinary connoisseur, a master of relaxation, a playful 
                partner-in-crime, and the cuddle champion of the world.
