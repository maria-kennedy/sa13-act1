                At Hogwarts, Luna the black pug is a proud member of Ravenclaw House, 
                where her keen intuition and curiosity set her apart. While the wizards 
                and witches cast spells and pore over ancient tomes, Luna's magical 
                talent lies in her ability to sniff out hidden treats and cozy napping 
                spots throughout the castle. She may not wield a wand, but Luna's loyal 
                companionship and sharp intellect make her an invaluable member of the 
                Ravenclaw community. With her, late-night study sessions are never lonely,
                as she snuggles close, offering comfort and companionship amidst the glow 
                of enchanted textbooks. Luna's Hogwarts experience is a blend of adventure 
                and relaxation, where she navigates the halls with the wisdom of a sage
                and the mischief of a mischievous pup, leaving paw prints on the 
                hearts of all who know her..
